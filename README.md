# Algebra

This project is dedicated to the studie of algebra. Here we're gonna work with the binary relations between numbers or letters and how they can be classified.

Given the following set A and the relation R
    
    A = { 1, 2, 3}
    R = { (1,1), (2,1) }

We can classify R with

    anti reflective
    anti symmetric
    transitive

We're gonna make this automatically using python
